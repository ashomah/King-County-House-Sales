#### Google Map API  

The project collects static map tiles from the Google *Maps Static API*. It uses an API key stored in the file `google.api` store in the root directory. You should visit the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis) to generate your own API key and save it in the file `google.api` to be able to generate your own maps.
